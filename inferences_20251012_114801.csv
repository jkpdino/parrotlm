1,1,1,Once upon a time," Once upon a time, there was a generous meadow. The generous meadow made life so wide with every snap of happiness in her new home. Rabbit clutched his bright red bucket tight as he skipped along the neighborhood sidewalk. The sidewalk was big and smooth, with no kids living nearby but a big fence fixed up inside. One sunny morning, Rabbit plopped down by a pond and scooped up most bright red flowers.ĊĊA loud peck came from nearby hummed late time. Rabbit froze, his paws shaking a little. But he stood up and clutched his new bouquet tighter, his tiny paws gripping tight.ĊĊGlittery blooms sparkled under the sun, healinging his sticky fur and firaasy grass against Rabbit's knees. ""Farmer! I'm lost,"" Rabbit called out, eyes close to the birds flapping above. The air smelled sweet like wet earth, but the ant traily trail looked the same.ĊĊRabbit froze as the anthill rolled into the corner, clicking pebbles and banging louder. Rabbit lifted the plants with shaky paws toward the darkening direction. The grass stuck to his toes, making weeds snap underfoot like laughs, but they only sought the earthy smell of wet dirt.ĊĊFurther along, berry branches shone like jewels, sweet like candy.

Bubbles showed a faint breeze that rang like flags. No familiar ant march left or right, only the sunny trees whispering hello.ĊĊRabbit stopped, ears perked up. One stone had fallen home ahead, its walls warm and gritty from the hum of rolling flowers. ""I need to clean my stones,"" he said, wiping his face but shaking his head loose. A sharp start echoed through the meetids, and berries scattered everywhere.ĊĊRabbit grabbed mud in his flippers and wiped his sides clean. He wiped the berries fast, then unwrapping the mud line, quick and quick. Juice dripped down a leaf, smelling fresh and fresh. Fishys cheered from a nearby bush, and he laughed, but found the lost water's edge.ĊĊRabbit dashed to the anthill",504,35.32220101356506,14.268646503836068,2025-10-12T11:48:01.940793,1.0,,,500,1.0
